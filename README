What is it?
-------------------
Mozilla-tiff-plugin is a plugin for viewing tiff images on browser.
It does not rely on any external application for viewing. A major 
chunk of the codebase is taken from mozilla-bonobo package.

Why?
-------------------
The available tiff plugins for the browser was mozplugger which spawned
any application of our choice to show images on the browser. The problem
with it was that when clicking on multiple images, the application would
open a new window and then get back to the browser and when the number of
images clicked in new tabs increased, the application would not get into 
the browser too. System would become unusally slow too. So I needed a more
smooth and less memory consuming replacement.
